I am a PhD student in [Programming Principles, Logic and Verification Group](http://pplv.cs.ucl.ac.uk/welcome/) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) supervised by [Prof. Alexandra Silva](https://alexandrasilva.org/#/main.html). My research interests mainly involve semantics of programming languages as well as formal verification. 

Before that I received a BSc in Computer Science from the [University of Southampton](https://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/), where I was supervised by [Dr Julian Rathke](https://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/jr1a06). As an intern, I worked in Software and Large Scale Systems Group in [ARM Research](https://www.arm.com/resources/research) in Cambridge, as well as in [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/careers/divisions/engineering/) in London.

In my free time, you can usually spot me hiking or horse riding through Polish bits of the Carpathian mountains.
