I am PhD student at [Programming Principles, Logic and Verification Group](http://pplv.cs.ucl.ac.uk/welcome/) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) and I work under supervision of [Prof. Alexandra Silva](https://alexandrasilva.org/#/main.html) from [Cornell University](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/). Before that I received a BSc in Computer Science from [University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/), where I was supervised by [https://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/jr1a06](Dr Julian Rathke) working on Agda-verified abstract machines for $lambda$-calculus.
